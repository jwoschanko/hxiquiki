# HorizonXI Quiki

Quick Wiki access for weird people that like FFXI and portmanteaus.

Lets you search the HorizonXI wiki using chat commands so you don't have to move the mouse all the way over to a browser window and hit the "new tab" button like a caveman.

## Usage

**General Use:**
```
/wiki <thing to search for>
```
Will open the Wiki page for Thing_to_Search_For (regardless of whether or not it exists)

**Crafting Stuff:**
```
/wiki <craft> <level>
```
to open the appropriate level range crafting page.  e.g., "/wiki Cooking 15" to open the 10-20 recipes page.
